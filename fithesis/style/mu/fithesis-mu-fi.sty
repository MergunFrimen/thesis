%% MODIFICATION ADVICE:
%% 
%% If you want to customize this file, it is best to make a copy of
%% the source file(s) from which it was produced.  Use a different
%% name for your copy(ies) and modify the copy(ies); this will ensure
%% that your modifications do not get overwritten when you install a
%% new release of the standard system.  You should also ensure that
%% your modified source file does not generate any modified file with
%% the same name as a standard file.
%% 
%% You will also need to produce your own, suitably named, .ins file to
%% control the generation of files from your source file; this file
%% should contain your own preambles for the files it generates, not
%% those in the standard .ins files.
%% 
%% The names of the source files used are shown above.
